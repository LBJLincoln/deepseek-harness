# Implement closestIndexTo from date-fns

`src/closestIndexTo/index.js` is the JavaScript build of `pkgs/core/src/closestIndexTo/index.ts` from date-fns (https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns at commit 717ce0a807ea, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `closestIndexTo`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * @name closestIndexTo
 * @category Common Helpers
 * @summary Return an index of the closest date from the array comparing to the given date.
 *
 * @description
 * Return an index of the closest date from the array comparing to the given date.
 *
 * **You don't need date-fns\***:
 *
 * Temporal doesn't have a built-in operation for finding the closest value in an array, so you still need date-fns for this.
 *
 * \* **Not really**, see: https://date-fns.org/you-dont-need-date-fns
 *
 * @param dateToCompare - The date to compare with
 * @param dates - The array to search
 *
 * @returns An index of the date closest to the given date or undefined if no valid value is given
 *
 * @example
 * // Which date is closer to 6 September 2015?
 * const dateToCompare = new Date(2015, 8, 6)
 * const datesArray = [
 *   new Date(2015, 0, 1),
 *   new Date(2016, 0, 1),
 *   new Date(2017, 0, 1)
 * ]
 * const result = closestIndexTo(dateToCompare, datesArray)
 * //=> 1
 */
export function closestIndexTo(
  dateToCompare: DateArg<Date> & {},
  dates: Array<DateArg<Date> & {}>,
): number | undefined

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constants/index.js`, `src/constructFrom/index.js`, `src/toDate/index.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
