# Implement variance from simple-statistics

`src/variance.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/variance.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `variance`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The [variance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)
 * is the sum of squared deviations from the mean.
 *
 * This is an implementation of variance, not sample variance:
 * see the `sampleVariance` method if you want a sample measure.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x a population of one or more data points
 * @returns {number} variance: a value greater than or equal to zero.
 * zero indicates that all values are identical.
 * @throws {Error} if x's length is 0
 * @example
 * variance([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); // => 2.9166666666666665
 */
function variance(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/combine_means.js`, `src/combine_variances.js`, `src/mean.js`, `src/sum.js`, `src/sum_nth_power_deviations.js`, `src/validate_weighted_input.js`, `src/weighted_mean.js`, `src/weighted_variance.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
