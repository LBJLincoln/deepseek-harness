# Implement rest from es-toolkit

`src/function/rest.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/function/rest.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `rest`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Creates a function that transforms the arguments of the provided function `func`.
 * The transformed arguments are passed to `func` such that the arguments starting from a specified index
 * are grouped into an array, while the previous arguments are passed as individual elements.
 *
 * @template F - The type of the function being transformed.
 * @param func - The function whose arguments are to be transformed.
 * @param [startIndex=func.length - 1] - The index from which to start grouping the remaining arguments into an array.
 *                                            Defaults to `func.length - 1`, grouping all arguments after the last parameter.
 * @returns A new function that, when called, returns the result of calling `func` with the transformed arguments.
 *
 * The transformed arguments are:
 * - The first `start` arguments as individual elements.
 * - The remaining arguments from index `start` onward grouped into an array.
 * @example
 * function fn(a, b, c) {
 *   return [a, b, c];
 * }
 *
 * // Using default start index (func.length - 1, which is 2 in this case)
 * const transformedFn = rest(fn);
 * console.log(transformedFn(1, 2, 3, 4)); // [1, 2, [3, 4]]
 *
 * // Using start index 1
 * const transformedFnWithStart = rest(fn, 1);
 * console.log(transformedFnWithStart(1, 2, 3, 4)); // [1, [2, 3, 4], undefined]
 *
 * // With fewer arguments than the start index
 * console.log(transformedFn(1)); // [1, undefined, []]

export function rest<F extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: F,
  startIndex = func.length - 1
): (...args: any[]) => ReturnType<F>

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
