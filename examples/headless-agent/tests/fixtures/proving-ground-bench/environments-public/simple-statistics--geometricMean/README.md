# Implement geometricMean from simple-statistics

`src/geometric_mean.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/geometric_mean.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `geometricMean`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The [Geometric Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) is
 * a mean function that is more useful for numbers in different
 * ranges.
 *
 * This is the nth root of the input numbers multiplied by each other.
 *
 * The geometric mean is often useful for
 * **[proportional growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean#Proportional_growth)**: given
 * growth rates for multiple years, like _80%, 16.66% and 42.85%_, a simple
 * mean will incorrectly estimate an average growth rate, whereas a geometric
 * mean will correctly estimate a growth rate that, over those years,
 * will yield the same end value.
 *
 * This runs in `O(n)`, linear time, with respect to the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x sample of one or more data points
 * @returns {number} geometric mean
 * @throws {Error} if x is empty
 * @throws {Error} if x contains a negative number
 * @example
 * var growthRates = [1.80, 1.166666, 1.428571];
 * var averageGrowth = ss.geometricMean(growthRates);
 * var averageGrowthRates = [averageGrowth, averageGrowth, averageGrowth];
 * var startingValue = 10;
 * var startingValueMean = 10;
 * growthRates.forEach(function(rate) {
 *   startingValue *= rate;
 * });
 * averageGrowthRates.forEach(function(rate) {
 *   startingValueMean *= rate;
 * });
 * startingValueMean === startingValue;
 */
function geometricMean(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/epsilon.js`, `src/log_average.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
