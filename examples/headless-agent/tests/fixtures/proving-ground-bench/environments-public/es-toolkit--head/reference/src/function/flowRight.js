/**
 * Creates a new function that executes the given functions in sequence from right to left. The return value of the previous function is passed as an argument to the next function.
 *
 * The `this` context of the returned function is also passed to the functions provided as parameters.
 *
 * This method is like `flow` except that it creates a function that invokes the given functions from right to left.
 *
 * @param funcs The functions to invoke.
 * @returns Returns the new composite function.
 *
 * @example
 * const add = (x: number, y: number) => x + y;
 * const square = (n: number) => n * n;
 *
 * const combined = flowRight(square, add);
 * console.log(combined(1, 2)); // 9
