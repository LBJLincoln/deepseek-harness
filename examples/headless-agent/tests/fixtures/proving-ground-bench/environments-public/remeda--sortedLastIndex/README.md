# Implement sortedLastIndex from remeda

`src/sortedLastIndex.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/sortedLastIndex.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `sortedLastIndex`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Find the insertion position (index) of an item in an array with items sorted
 * in ascending order; so that `splice(sortedIndex, 0, item)` would result in
 * maintaining the array's sort-ness. The array can contain duplicates.
 * If the item already exists in the array the index would be of the *last*
 * occurrence of the item.
 *
 * Runs in O(logN) time.
 *
 * @param data - The (ascending) sorted array.
 * @param item - The item to insert.
 * @returns Insertion index (In the range 0..data.length).
 * @signature
 *    sortedLastIndex(data, item)
 * @example
 *    sortedLastIndex(['a','a','b','c','c'], 'c') // => 5
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array
 * @see sortedIndex, sortedIndexBy, sortedIndexWith, sortedLastIndexBy
 */
export function sortedLastIndex(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/binarySearchCutoffIndex.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
