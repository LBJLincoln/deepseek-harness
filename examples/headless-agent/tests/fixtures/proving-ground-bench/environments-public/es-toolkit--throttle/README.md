# Implement throttle from es-toolkit

`src/function/throttle.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/function/throttle.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `throttle`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Creates a throttled function that only invokes the provided function at most once
 * per every `throttleMs` milliseconds. Subsequent calls to the throttled function
 * within the wait time will not trigger the execution of the original function.
 *
 * @template F - The type of function.
 * @param func - The function to throttle.
 * @param throttleMs - The number of milliseconds to throttle executions to.
 * @returns A new throttled function that accepts the same parameters as the original function.
 *
 * @example
 * const throttledFunction = throttle(() => {
 *   console.log('Function executed');
 * }, 1000);
 *
 * // Will log 'Function executed' immediately
 * throttledFunction();
 *
 * // Will not log anything as it is within the throttle time
 * throttledFunction();
 *
 * // After 1 second
 * setTimeout(() => {
 *   throttledFunction(); // Will log 'Function executed'
 * }, 1000);
 */
export function throttle<F extends (...args: any[]) => void>(
  func: F,
  throttleMs: number,
  { signal, edges = ['leading', 'trailing'] }: ThrottleOptions = {}
): ThrottledFunction<F>

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/_internal/DOMException.js`, `src/_internal/globalThis.js`, `src/error/AbortError.js`, `src/function/debounce.js`, `src/promise/delay.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.

## Attribution

This task is derived from `src/function/throttle.ts` of es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit) at commit `d6f796064886b6229385c5f3e6165dab584ebfb6`, distributed under the MIT licence (Copyright (c) 2024 Viva Republica, Inc.); the licence text is kept in `LICENSE` and accompanies every copy of this task and anything derived from it.

## Types the module declares

The module's TypeScript source declares these types; the JavaScript build in `src/function/throttle.js` erased them.

```ts
export interface ThrottleOptions {
  /**
   * An optional AbortSignal to cancel the throttled function.
   */
  signal?: AbortSignal;

  /**
   * An optional array specifying whether the function should be invoked on the leading edge, trailing edge, or both.
   * If `edges` includes "leading", the function will be invoked at the start of the delay period.
   * If `edges` includes "trailing", the function will be invoked at the end of the delay period.
   * If both "leading" and "trailing" are included, the function will be invoked at both the start and end of the delay period.
   * @default ["leading", "trailing"]
   */
  edges?: Array<'leading' | 'trailing'>;
}

export interface ThrottledFunction<F extends (...args: any[]) => void> {
  (...args: Parameters<F>): void;
  cancel: () => void;
  flush: () => void;
}
```
