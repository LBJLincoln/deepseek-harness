# Implement at from es-toolkit

`src/array/at.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/array/at.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `at`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Retrieves elements from an array at the specified indices.
 *
 * This function supports negative indices, which count from the end of the array.
 *
 * @template T
 * @param arr - The array to retrieve elements from.
 * @param indices - An array of indices specifying the positions of elements to retrieve.
 * @returns A new array containing the elements at the specified indices.
 *
 * @example
 * const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
 * const result = at(numbers, [1, 3, 4]);
 * console.log(result); // [20, 40, 50]
 */
export function at<T>(arr: readonly T[], indices: readonly number[]): T[]

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
