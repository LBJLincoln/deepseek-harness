# Implement monthsToQuarters from date-fns

`src/monthsToQuarters/index.js` is the JavaScript build of `pkgs/core/src/monthsToQuarters/index.ts` from date-fns (https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns at commit 717ce0a807ea, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `monthsToQuarters`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * @name monthsToQuarters
 * @category Conversion Helpers
 * @summary Convert number of months to quarters.
 *
 * @description
 * Convert a number of months to a full number of quarters.
 *
 * @param months - The number of months to be converted.
 *
 * @returns The number of months converted in quarters
 *
 * @example
 * // Convert 6 months to quarters:
 * const result = monthsToQuarters(6)
 * //=> 2
 *
 * @example
 * // It uses floor rounding:
 * const result = monthsToQuarters(7)
 * //=> 2
 */
export function monthsToQuarters(months: number): number

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constants/index.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
