# Implement intersection from es-toolkit

`src/array/intersection.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/array/intersection.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `intersection`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Returns the intersection of two arrays.
 *
 * This function takes two arrays and returns a new array containing the elements that are
 * present in both arrays. It effectively filters out any elements from the first array that
 * are not found in the second array.
 *
 * @template T - The type of elements in the array.
 * @param firstArr - The first array to compare.
 * @param secondArr - The second array to compare.
 * @returns A new array containing the elements that are present in both arrays.
 *
 * @example
 * const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 * const array2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
 * const result = intersection(array1, array2);
 * // result will be [3, 4, 5] since these elements are in both arrays.
 */
export function intersection<T>(firstArr: readonly T[], secondArr: readonly T[]): T[]

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
