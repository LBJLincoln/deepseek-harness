# Implement isDeepEqual from remeda

`src/isDeepEqual.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/isDeepEqual.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `isDeepEqual`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Performs a *deep structural* comparison between two values to determine if
 * they are equivalent. For primitive values this is equivalent to `===`, for
 * arrays the check would be performed on every item recursively, in order, and
 * for objects all props will be compared recursively.
 *
 * The built-in Date and RegExp are special-cased and will be compared by their
 * values. Objects with a `null` prototype are comparable to plain objects by
 * their enumerable properties.
 *
 * !IMPORTANT: TypedArrays and symbol properties of objects are not supported
 * right now and might result in unexpected behavior. Please open an issue in
 * the Remeda github project if you need support for these types.
 *
 * The result would be narrowed to the second value so that the function can be
 * used as a type guard.
 *
 * See:
 * - `isStrictEqual` if you don't need a deep comparison and just want to
 * check for simple (`===`, `Object.is`) equality.
 * - `isShallowEqual` if you need to compare arrays and objects "by-value" but
 * don't want to recurse into their values.
 *
 * @param data - The first value to compare.
 * @param other - The second value to compare.
 * @signature
 *    isDeepEqual(data, other)
 * @example
 *    isDeepEqual(1, 1) //=> true
 *    isDeepEqual(1, '1') //=> false
 *    isDeepEqual([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) //=> true
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Guard

export function isDeepEqual(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/conditional.js`, `src/constant.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/purryOn.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
