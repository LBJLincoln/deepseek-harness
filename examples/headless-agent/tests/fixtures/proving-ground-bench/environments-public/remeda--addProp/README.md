# Implement addProp from remeda

`src/addProp.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/addProp.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `addProp`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Add a new property to an object.
 *
 * The function doesn't do any checks on the input object. If the property
 * already exists it will be overwritten, and the type of the new value is not
 * checked against the previous type.
 *
 * Use `set` to override values explicitly with better protections.
 *
 * @param obj - The target object.
 * @param prop - The property name.
 * @param value - The property value.
 * @signature
 *    addProp(obj, prop, value)
 * @example
 *    addProp({firstName: 'john'}, 'lastName', 'doe') // => {firstName: 'john', lastName: 'doe'}
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Object
 */
export function addProp(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
