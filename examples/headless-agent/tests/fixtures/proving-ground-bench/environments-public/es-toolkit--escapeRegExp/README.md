# Implement escapeRegExp from es-toolkit

`src/string/escapeRegExp.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/string/escapeRegExp.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `escapeRegExp`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Escapes the RegExp special characters "^", "$", "\\", ".", "*", "+", "?", "(", ")", "[", "]", "{", "}", and "|" in `str`.
 *
 * @param str The string to escape.
 * @returns Returns the escaped string.
 *
 * @example
 * import { escapeRegExp } from 'es-toolkit/string';
 *
 * escapeRegExp('[es-toolkit](https://es-toolkit.dev/)'); // returns '\[es-toolkit\]\(https://es-toolkit\.dev/\)'
 */
export function escapeRegExp(str: string): string

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
