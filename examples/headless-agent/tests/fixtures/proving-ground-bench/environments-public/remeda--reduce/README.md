# Implement reduce from remeda

`src/reduce.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/reduce.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `reduce`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the
 * array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the
 * preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all
 * elements of the array is a single value. Equivalent to
 * `Array.prototype.reduce`.
 *
 * @param data - The items to reduce.
 * @param callbackfn - A function to execute for each element in the array. Its
 * return value becomes the value of the accumulator parameter on the next
 * invocation of callbackFn. For the last invocation, the return value becomes
 * the return value of reduce().
 * @param initialValue - A value to which accumulator is initialized the first
 * time the callback is called. CallbackFn starts executing with the first value
 * in the array as currentValue.
 * @returns The value that results from running the "reducer" callback function
 * to completion over the entire array.
 * @signature
 *    reduce(data, callbackfn, initialValue)
 * @example
 *    reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (acc, x) => acc + x, 100) // => 115
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array

export function reduce(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/add.js`, `src/constant.js`, `src/evolve.js`, `src/hasAtLeast.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/length.js`, `src/map.js`, `src/omit.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`, `src/set.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
