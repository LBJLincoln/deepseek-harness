# Implement harmonicMean from simple-statistics

`src/harmonic_mean.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/harmonic_mean.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `harmonicMean`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The [Harmonic Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) is
 * a mean function typically used to find the average of rates.
 * This mean is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean
 * of the reciprocals of the input numbers.
 *
 * This is a [measure of central tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency):
 * a method of finding a typical or central value of a set of numbers.
 *
 * This runs in `O(n)`, linear time, with respect to the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x sample of one or more data points
 * @returns {number} harmonic mean
 * @throws {Error} if x is empty
 * @throws {Error} if x contains a negative number
 * @example
 * harmonicMean([2, 3]).toFixed(2) // => '2.40'
 */
function harmonicMean(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
