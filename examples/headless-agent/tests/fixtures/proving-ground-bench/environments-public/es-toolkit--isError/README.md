# Implement isError from es-toolkit

`src/predicate/isError.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/predicate/isError.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `isError`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Checks if `value` is an Error object.
 *
 * @param value The value to check.
 * @returns Returns `true` if `value` is an Error object, `false` otherwise.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * console.log(isError(new Error())); // true
 * console.log(isError('Error')); // false
 * console.log(isError({ name: 'Error', message: '' })); // false
 * ```
 */
export function isError(value: unknown): value is Error

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
