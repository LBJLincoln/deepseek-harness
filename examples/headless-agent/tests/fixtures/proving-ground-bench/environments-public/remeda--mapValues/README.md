# Implement mapValues from remeda

`src/mapValues.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/mapValues.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `mapValues`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Maps values of `object` and keeps the same keys. Symbol keys are not passed
 * to the mapper and will be removed from the output object.
 *
 * To also copy the symbol keys to the output use merge:
 * `merge(data, mapValues(data, mapper))`).
 *
 * @param data - The object to map.
 * @param valueMapper - The mapping function.
 * @signature
 *    mapValues(data, mapper)
 * @example
 *    mapValues({a: 1, b: 2}, (value, key) => value + key) // => {a: '1a', b: '2b'}
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Object
 */
export function mapValues(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constant.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/map.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`, `src/range.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.

## Attribution

This task is derived from `packages/remeda/src/mapValues.ts` of remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda) at commit `e8292ddf03f8a334cf8b048983d518f89fe6be97`, distributed under the MIT licence (Copyright (c) 2018 remeda); the licence text is kept in `LICENSE` and accompanies every copy of this task and anything derived from it.

## Types the module declares

The module's TypeScript source declares these types; the JavaScript build in `src/mapValues.js` erased them.

```ts
type MappedValues<T extends object, Value> = Simplify<{
  -readonly [P in keyof T as P extends number | string ? P : never]: Value;
}>;
```
