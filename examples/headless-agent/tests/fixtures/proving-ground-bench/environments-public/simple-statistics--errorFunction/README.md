# Implement errorFunction from simple-statistics

`src/error_function.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/error_function.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `errorFunction`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * **[Gaussian error function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function)**
 *
 * The `errorFunction(x/(sd * Math.sqrt(2)))` is the probability that a value in a
 * normal distribution with standard deviation sd is within x of the mean.
 *
 * This function returns a numerical approximation to the exact value.
 * It uses Horner's method to evaluate the polynomial of τ (tau).
 *
 * @param {number} x input
 * @return {number} error estimation
 * @example
 * errorFunction(1).toFixed(2); // => '0.84'
 */
function errorFunction(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/cumulative_std_logistic_probability.js`, `src/cumulative_std_normal_probability.js`, `src/epsilon.js`, `src/inverse_error_function.js`, `src/probit.js`, `src/standard_normal_table.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
