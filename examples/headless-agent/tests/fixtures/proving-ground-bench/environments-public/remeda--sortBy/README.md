# Implement sortBy from remeda

`src/sortBy.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/sortBy.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `sortBy`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Sorts `data` using the provided ordering rules. The `sort` is done via the
 * native `Array.prototype.sort` but is performed on a shallow copy of the array
 * to avoid mutating the original data.
 *
 * There are several other functions that take order rules and **bypass** the
 * need to sort the array first (in *O(nlogn)* time):
 * * `firstBy` === `first(sortBy(data, ...rules))`, O(n).
 * * `takeFirstBy` === `take(sortBy(data, ...rules), k)`, O(nlogk).
 * * `dropFirstBy` === `drop(sortBy(data, ...rules), k)`, O(nlogk).
 * * `nthBy` === `sortBy(data, ...rules).at(k)`, O(n).
 * * `rankBy` === `sortedIndex(sortBy(data, ...rules), item)`, O(n).
 * Refer to the docs for more details.
 *
 * @param sortRules - A variadic array of order rules defining the sorting
 * criteria. Each order rule is a projection function that extracts a comparable
 * value from the data. Sorting is based on these extracted values using the
 * native `<` and `>` operators. Earlier rules take precedence over later ones.
 * Use the syntax `[projection, "desc"]` for descending order.
 * @returns A shallow copy of the input array sorted by the provided rules.
 * @signature
 *    sortBy(...rules)(data)
 * @example
 *    pipe(
 *      [{ a: 1 }, { a: 3 }, { a: 7 }, { a: 2 }],
 *      sortBy(prop('a')),
 *    ); // => [{ a: 1 }, { a: 2 }, { a: 3 }, { a: 7 }]
 * @dataLast
 * @category Array

export function sortBy(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/purryOrderRules.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/map.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/prop.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
