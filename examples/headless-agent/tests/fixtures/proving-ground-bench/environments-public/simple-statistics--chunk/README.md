# Implement chunk from simple-statistics

`src/chunk.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/chunk.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `chunk`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Split an array into chunks of a specified size. This function
 * has the same behavior as [PHP's array_chunk](http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk.php)
 * function, and thus will insert smaller-sized chunks at the end if
 * the input size is not divisible by the chunk size.
 *
 * `x` is expected to be an array, and `chunkSize` a number.
 * The `x` array can contain any kind of data.
 *
 * @param {Array} x a sample
 * @param {number} chunkSize size of each output array. must be a positive integer
 * @returns {Array<Array>} a chunked array
 * @throws {Error} if chunk size is less than 1 or not an integer
 * @example
 * chunk([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2);
 * // => [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
 */
function chunk(x, chunkSize)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
