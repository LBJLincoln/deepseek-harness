# Implement filter from remeda

`src/filter.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/filter.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `filter`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just
 * the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the
 * provided function. Equivalent to `Array.prototype.filter`.
 *
 * Related operations:
 * - `splice` - to shape the array by *position* rather than by *value*.
 *
 * @param data - The array to filter.
 * @param predicate - A function to execute for each element in the array. It
 * should return `true` to keep the element in the resulting array, and `false`
 * otherwise. A type-predicate can also be used to narrow the result.
 * @returns A shallow copy of the given array containing just the elements that
 * pass the test. If no elements pass the test, an empty array is returned.
 * @signature
 *    filter(data, predicate)
 * @example
 *    filter([1, 2, 3], x => x % 2 === 1) // => [1, 3]
 * @dataFirst
 * @lazy
 * @category Array
 */
export function filter(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/add.js`, `src/constant.js`, `src/flat.js`, `src/identity.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/purryFromLazy.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/isIncludedIn.js`, `src/isNot.js`, `src/map.js`, `src/multiply.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/prop.js`, `src/purry.js`, `src/take.js`, `src/tap.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
