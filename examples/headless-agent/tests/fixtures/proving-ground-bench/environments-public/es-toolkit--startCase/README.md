# Implement startCase from es-toolkit

`src/string/startCase.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/string/startCase.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `startCase`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Converts the first character of each word in a string to uppercase and the remaining characters to lowercase.
 *
 * Start case is the naming convention in which each word is written with an initial capital letter.
 * @param str - The string to convert.
 * @returns The converted string.
 *
 * @example
 * const result1 = startCase('hello world');  // result will be 'Hello World'
 * const result2 = startCase('HELLO WORLD');  // result will be 'Hello World'
 * const result3 = startCase('hello-world');  // result will be 'Hello World'
 * const result4 = startCase('hello_world');  // result will be 'Hello World'
 */
export function startCase(str: string): string

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/string/words.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
