# Implement interquartileRange from simple-statistics

`src/interquartile_range.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/interquartile_range.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `interquartileRange`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The [Interquartile range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) is
 * a measure of statistical dispersion, or how scattered, spread, or
 * concentrated a distribution is. It's computed as the difference between
 * the third quartile and first quartile.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x sample of one or more numbers
 * @returns {number} interquartile range: the span between lower and upper quartile,
 * 0.25 and 0.75
 * @example
 * interquartileRange([0, 1, 2, 3]); // => 1.5
 */
function interquartileRange(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/quantile.js`, `src/quantile_sorted.js`, `src/quickselect.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
