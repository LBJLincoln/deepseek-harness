# Implement combinationsReplacement from simple-statistics

`src/combinations_replacement.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/combinations_replacement.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `combinationsReplacement`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Implementation of [Combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) with replacement
 * Combinations are unique subsets of a collection - in this case, k x from a collection at a time.
 * 'With replacement' means that a given element can be chosen multiple times.
 * Unlike permutation, order doesn't matter for combinations.
 *
 * @param {Array} x any type of data
 * @param {int} k the number of objects in each group (without replacement)
 * @returns {Array<Array>} array of permutations
 * @example
 * combinationsReplacement([1, 2], 2); // => [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]]
 */
function combinationsReplacement(x, k)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
