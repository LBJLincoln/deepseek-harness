# Implement mapWithFeedback from remeda

`src/mapWithFeedback.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/mapWithFeedback.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `mapWithFeedback`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Applies a function on each element of the array, using the result of the
 * previous application, and returns an array of the successively computed
 * values.
 *
 * @param data - The array to map over.
 * @param callbackfn - The callback function that receives the previous value,
 * the current element.
 * @param initialValue - The initial value to start the computation with.
 * @returns An array of successively computed values from the left side of the
 * array.
 * @signature
 *    mapWithFeedback(data, callbackfn, initialValue);
 * @example
 *    mapWithFeedback(
 *      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
 *      (prev, x) => prev + x,
 *      100,
 *    ); // => [101, 103, 106, 110, 115]
 * @dataFirst
 * @lazy
 * @category Array
 */
export function mapWithFeedback(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/purryFromLazy.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/map.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`, `src/take.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.

## Attribution

This task is derived from `packages/remeda/src/mapWithFeedback.ts` of remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda) at commit `e8292ddf03f8a334cf8b048983d518f89fe6be97`, distributed under the MIT licence (Copyright (c) 2018 remeda); the licence text is kept in `LICENSE` and accompanies every copy of this task and anything derived from it.

## Types the module declares

The module's TypeScript source declares these types; the JavaScript build in `src/mapWithFeedback.js` erased them.

```ts
type LazyFeedbackCallback<T extends IterableContainer, U> = (
  previousValue: U,
  currentValue: T[number],
  currentIndex: number,
  data: Readonly<NonEmptyPrefix<T>>,
) => U;
```
