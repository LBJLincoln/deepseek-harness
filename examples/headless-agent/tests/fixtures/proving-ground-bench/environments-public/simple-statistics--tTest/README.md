# Implement tTest from simple-statistics

`src/t_test.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/t_test.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `tTest`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * This is to compute [a one-sample t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#One-sample_t-test), comparing the mean
 * of a sample to a known value, x.
 *
 * in this case, we're trying to determine whether the
 * population mean is equal to the value that we know, which is `x`
 * here. Usually the results here are used to look up a
 * [p-value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), which, for
 * a certain level of significance, will let you determine that the
 * null hypothesis can or cannot be rejected.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x sample of one or more numbers
 * @param {number} expectedValue expected value of the population mean
 * @returns {number} value
 * @example
 * tTest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3.385).toFixed(2); // => '0.16'
 */
function tTest(x, expectedValue)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/mean.js`, `src/standard_deviation.js`, `src/sum.js`, `src/sum_nth_power_deviations.js`, `src/variance.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
