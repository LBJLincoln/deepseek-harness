# Implement minBy from es-toolkit

`src/array/minBy.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/array/minBy.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `minBy`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Finds the element in an array that has the minimum value when applying
 * the `getValue` function to each element.
 *
 * @template T - The type of elements in the array.
 * @param items The array of elements to search.
 * @param getValue A function that selects a numeric value from each element.
 * @returns The element with the minimum value as determined by the `getValue` function,
 * or `undefined` if the array is empty.
 * @example
 * minBy([{ a: 1 }, { a: 2 }, { a: 3 }], x => x.a); // Returns: { a: 1 }
 * minBy([], x => x.a); // Returns: undefined
 * minBy([3, NaN, 1], x => x); // Returns: NaN (NaN propagates, matching Math.min)
 * minBy(
 *   [
 *     { name: 'john', age: 30 },
 *     { name: 'jane', age: 28 },
 *     { name: 'joe', age: 26 },
 *   ],
 *   x => x.age
 * ); // Returns: { name: 'joe', age: 26 }
 */
export function minBy<T>(
  items: readonly T[],
  getValue: (element: T, index: number, array: readonly T[]) => number
): T | undefined

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
