# Implement bernoulliDistribution from simple-statistics

`src/bernoulli_distribution.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/bernoulli_distribution.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `bernoulliDistribution`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The [Bernoulli distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution)
 * is the probability discrete
 * distribution of a random variable which takes value 1 with success
 * probability `p` and value 0 with failure
 * probability `q` = 1 - `p`. It can be used, for example, to represent the
 * toss of a coin, where "1" is defined to mean "heads" and "0" is defined
 * to mean "tails" (or vice versa). It is
 * a special case of a Binomial Distribution
 * where `n` = 1.
 *
 * @param {number} p input value, between 0 and 1 inclusive
 * @returns {number[]} values of bernoulli distribution at this point
 * @throws {Error} if p is outside 0 and 1
 * @example
 * bernoulliDistribution(0.3); // => [0.7, 0.3]
 */
function bernoulliDistribution(p) /*: number[] */

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/epsilon.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
