# Implement groupBy from remeda

`src/groupBy.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/groupBy.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `groupBy`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Groups the elements of a given iterable according to the string values
 * returned by a provided callback function. The returned object has separate
 * properties for each group, containing arrays with the elements in the group.
 * Unlike the built in `Object.groupBy` this function also allows the callback to
 * return `undefined` in order to exclude the item from being added to any
 * group.
 *
 * If you are grouping objects by a property of theirs (e.g.
 * `groupBy(data, ({ myProp }) => myProp)` or `groupBy(data, prop('myProp'))`)
 * consider using `groupByProp` (e.g. `groupByProp(data, 'myProp')`) instead,
 * as it would provide better typing.
 *
 * @param data - The items to group.
 * @param callbackfn - A function to execute for each element in the iterable.
 * It should return a value indicating the group of the current element, or
 * `undefined` when the item should be excluded from any group.
 * @returns An object with properties for all groups, each assigned to an array
 * containing the elements of the associated group.
 * @signature
 *    groupBy(data, callbackfn)
 * @example
 *    groupBy([{a: 'cat'}, {a: 'dog'}] as const, prop('a')) // => {cat: [{a: 'cat'}], dog: [{a: 'dog'}]}
 *    groupBy([0, 1], x => x % 2 === 0 ? 'even' : undefined) // => {even: [0]}
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array

export function groupBy(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/prop.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
