# Implement factorial from simple-statistics

`src/factorial.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/factorial.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `factorial`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * A [Factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial), usually written n!, is the product of all positive
 * integers less than or equal to n. Often factorial is implemented
 * recursively, but this iterative approach is significantly faster
 * and simpler.
 *
 * @param {number} n input, must be an integer number 1 or greater
 * @returns {number} factorial: n!
 * @throws {Error} if n is less than 0 or not an integer
 * @example
 * factorial(5); // => 120
 */
function factorial(n)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
