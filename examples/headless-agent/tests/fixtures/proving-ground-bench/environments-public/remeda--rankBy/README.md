# Implement rankBy from remeda

`src/rankBy.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/rankBy.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `rankBy`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Calculates the rank of an item in an array based on `rules`. The rank is the position where the item would appear in the sorted array. This function provides an efficient way to determine the rank in *O(n)* time, compared to *O(nlogn)* for the equivalent `sortedIndex(sortBy(data, ...rules), item)`.
 *
 * @param data - The input array.
 * @param item - The item whose rank is to be determined.
 * @param rules - A variadic array of order rules defining the sorting criteria. Each order rule is a projection function that extracts a comparable value from the data. Sorting is based on these extracted values using the native `<` and `>` operators. Earlier rules take precedence over later ones. Use the syntax `[projection, "desc"]` for descending order.
 * @returns The rank of the item in the sorted array in the range [0..data.length].
 * @signature
 *   rankBy(data, item, ...rules)
 * @example
 *   const DATA = [{ a: 5 }, { a: 1 }, { a: 3 }] as const;
 *   rankBy(DATA, 0, prop('a')) // => 0
 *   rankBy(DATA, 1, prop('a')) // => 1
 *   rankBy(DATA, 2, prop('a')) // => 1
 *   rankBy(DATA, 3, prop('a')) // => 2
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array

export function rankBy(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/identity.js`, `src/internal/purryOrderRules.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
