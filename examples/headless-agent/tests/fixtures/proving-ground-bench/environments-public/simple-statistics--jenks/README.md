# Implement jenks from simple-statistics

`src/jenks.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/jenks.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `jenks`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The **[jenks natural breaks optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization)**
 * is an algorithm commonly used in cartography and visualization to decide
 * upon groupings of data values that minimize variance within themselves
 * and maximize variation between themselves.
 *
 * For instance, cartographers often use jenks in order to choose which
 * values are assigned to which colors in a [choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map)
 * map.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} data input data, as an array of number values
 * @param {number} nClasses number of desired classes
 * @returns {Array<number> | null} array of class break positions, or null
 * when nClasses is greater than the number of data points
 * @example
 * // split data into 3 break points
 * jenks([1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 20], 3) // = [1, 7, 20, 20]
 */
function jenks(data, nClasses)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/jenks_breaks.js`, `src/jenks_matrices.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
