# Implement isSameMinute from date-fns

`src/isSameMinute/index.js` is the JavaScript build of `pkgs/core/src/isSameMinute/index.ts` from date-fns (https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns at commit 717ce0a807ea, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `isSameMinute`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * @name isSameMinute
 * @category Minute Helpers
 * @summary Are the given dates in the same minute (and hour and day)?
 *
 * @description
 * Are the given dates in the same minute (and hour and day)?
 *
 * @param laterDate - The first date to check
 * @param earlierDate - The second date to check
 *
 * @returns The dates are in the same minute (and hour and day)
 *
 * @example
 * // Are 4 September 2014 06:30:00 and 4 September 2014 06:30:15 in the same minute?
 * const result = isSameMinute(
 *   new Date(2014, 8, 4, 6, 30),
 *   new Date(2014, 8, 4, 6, 30, 15)
 * )
 * //=> true
 *
 * @example
 * // Are 4 September 2014 06:30:00 and 5 September 2014 06:30:00 in the same minute?
 * const result = isSameMinute(
 *   new Date(2014, 8, 4, 6, 30),
 *   new Date(2014, 8, 5, 6, 30)
 * )
 * //=> false
 */
export function isSameMinute(
  laterDate: DateArg<Date> & {},
  earlierDate: DateArg<Date> & {},
): boolean

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constants/index.js`, `src/constructFrom/index.js`, `src/startOfMinute/index.js`, `src/toDate/index.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
