# Implement words from es-toolkit

`src/string/words.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/string/words.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `words`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Splits `string` into an array of its words, treating spaces and punctuation marks as separators.
 *
 * @param str The string to inspect.
 * @param [pattern] The pattern to match words.
 * @returns Returns the words of `string`.
 *
 * @example
 * words('fred, barney, & pebbles');
 * // => ['fred', 'barney', 'pebbles']
 *
 * words('camelCaseHTTPRequest🚀');
 * // => ['camel', 'Case', 'HTTP', 'Request', '🚀']
 *
 * words('Lunedì 18 Set')
 * // => ['Lunedì', '18', 'Set']
 */
export function words(str: string): string[]

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
