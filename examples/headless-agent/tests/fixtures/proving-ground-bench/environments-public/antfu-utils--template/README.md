# Implement template from antfu-utils

`src/string.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/string.ts` from antfu-utils (https://github.com/antfu/utils at commit 91f8cf73bebd, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `template`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Dead simple template engine, just like Python's `.format()`
 * Support passing variables as either in index based or object/name based approach
 * While using object/name based approach, you can pass a fallback value as the third argument
 *
 * @category String
 * @example
 * ```
 * const result = template(
 *   'Hello {0}! My name is {1}.',
 *   'Inès',
 *   'Anthony'
 * ) // Hello Inès! My name is Anthony.
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * const result = namedTemplate(
 *   '{greet}! My name is {name}.',
 *   { greet: 'Hello', name: 'Anthony' }
 * ) // Hello! My name is Anthony.
 * ```
 *
 * const result = namedTemplate(
 *   '{greet}! My name is {name}.',
 *   { greet: 'Hello' }, // name isn't passed hence fallback will be used for name
 *   'placeholder'
 * ) // Hello! My name is placeholder.
 * ```
 */
export function template(str: string, ...args: any[]): string

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/base.js`, `src/is.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
