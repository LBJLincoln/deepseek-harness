# Implement combineVariances from simple-statistics

`src/combine_variances.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/combine_variances.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `combineVariances`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * When combining two lists of values for which one already knows the variances,
 * one does not have to necessary recompute the variance of the combined lists
 * in linear time. They can instead use this function to compute the combined
 * variance by providing the variance, mean & number of values of the first list
 * and the variance, mean & number of values of the second list.
 *
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @param {number} variance1 variance of the first list
 * @param {number} mean1 mean of the first list
 * @param {number} n1 number of items in the first list
 * @param {number} variance2 variance of the second list
 * @param {number} mean2 mean of the second list
 * @param {number} n2 number of items in the second list
 * @returns {number} the combined mean
 *
 * @example
 * combineVariances(14 / 3, 5, 3, 8 / 3, 4, 3); // => 47 / 12
 */
function combineVariances(variance1, mean1, n1, variance2, mean2, n2)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/combine_means.js`, `src/mean.js`, `src/sum.js`, `src/sum_nth_power_deviations.js`, `src/variance.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
