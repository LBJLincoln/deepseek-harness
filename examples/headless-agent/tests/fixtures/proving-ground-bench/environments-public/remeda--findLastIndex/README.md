# Implement findLastIndex from remeda

`src/findLastIndex.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/findLastIndex.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `findLastIndex`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Iterates the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first
 * element that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy
 * the testing function, -1 is returned.
 *
 * See also `findLast` which returns the value of last element that satisfies
 * the testing function (rather than its index).
 *
 * @param data - The items to search in.
 * @param predicate - A function to execute for each element in the array. It
 * should return `true` to indicate a matching element has been found, and
 * `false` otherwise.
 * @returns The index of the last (highest-index) element in the array that
 * passes the test. Otherwise -1 if no matching element is found.
 * @signature
 *    findLastIndex(data, predicate)
 * @example
 *    findLastIndex([1, 3, 4, 6], n => n % 2 === 1) // => 1
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array
 */
export function findLastIndex(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
