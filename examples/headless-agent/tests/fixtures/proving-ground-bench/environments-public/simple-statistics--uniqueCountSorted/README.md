# Implement uniqueCountSorted from simple-statistics

`src/unique_count_sorted.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/unique_count_sorted.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `uniqueCountSorted`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * For a sorted input, counting the number of unique values
 * is possible in constant time and constant memory. This is
 * a simple implementation of the algorithm.
 *
 * Values are compared with `===`, so objects and non-primitive objects
 * are not handled in any special way.
 *
 * @param {Array<*>} x an array of any kind of value
 * @returns {number} count of unique values
 * @example
 * uniqueCountSorted([1, 2, 3]); // => 3
 * uniqueCountSorted([1, 1, 1]); // => 1
 */
function uniqueCountSorted(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
