# Implement hasAtLeast from remeda

`src/hasAtLeast.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/hasAtLeast.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `hasAtLeast`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Checks if the given array has at least the defined number of elements. When
 * the minimum used is a literal (e.g. `3`) the output is refined accordingly so
 * that those indices are defined when accessing the array even when using
 * typescript's 'noUncheckedIndexAccess'.
 *
 * @param data - The input array.
 * @param minimum - The minimum number of elements the array must have.
 * @returns True if the array's length is *at least* `minimum`. When `minimum`
 * is a literal value, the output is narrowed to ensure the first items are
 * guaranteed.
 * @signature
 *   hasAtLeast(data, minimum)
 * @example
 *   hasAtLeast([], 4); // => false
 *
 *   const data: number[] = [1,2,3,4];
 *   hasAtLeast(data, 1); // => true
 *   data[0]; // 1, with type `number`
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array
 */
export function hasAtLeast(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
