# Implement equalIntervalBreaks from simple-statistics

`src/equal_interval_breaks.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/equal_interval_breaks.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `equalIntervalBreaks`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Given an array of x, this will find the extent of the
 * x and return an array of breaks that can be used
 * to categorize the x into a number of classes. The
 * returned array will always be 1 longer than the number of
 * classes because it includes the minimum value.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x an array of number values
 * @param {number} nClasses number of desired classes
 * @returns {Array<number>} array of class break positions
 * @example
 * equalIntervalBreaks([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4); // => [1, 2.25, 3.5, 4.75, 6]
 */
function equalIntervalBreaks(x, nClasses)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/max.js`, `src/min.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
