# Implement sampleCorrelation from simple-statistics

`src/sample_correlation.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/sample_correlation.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `sampleCorrelation`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The [correlation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence) is
 * a measure of how correlated two datasets are, between -1 and 1
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x first input
 * @param {Array<number>} y second input
 * @returns {number} sample correlation
 * @example
 * sampleCorrelation([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 60]).toFixed(2);
 * // => '0.69'
 */
function sampleCorrelation(x, y)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/epsilon.js`, `src/mean.js`, `src/sample_covariance.js`, `src/sample_rank_correlation.js`, `src/sample_standard_deviation.js`, `src/sample_variance.js`, `src/sum.js`, `src/sum_nth_power_deviations.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
