# Implement min from simple-statistics

`src/min.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/min.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `min`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * The min is the lowest number in the array.
 * This runs in `O(n)`, linear time, with respect to the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x sample of one or more data points
 * @throws {Error} if the length of x is less than one
 * @returns {number} minimum value
 * @example
 * min([1, 5, -10, 100, 2]); // => -10
 */
function min(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/extent.js`, `src/extent_sorted.js`, `src/max.js`, `src/max_sorted.js`, `src/median.js`, `src/min_sorted.js`, `src/quantile.js`, `src/quantile_sorted.js`, `src/quickselect.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
