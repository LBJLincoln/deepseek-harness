# Implement getUnixTime from date-fns

`src/getUnixTime/index.js` is the JavaScript build of `pkgs/core/src/getUnixTime/index.ts` from date-fns (https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns at commit 717ce0a807ea, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `getUnixTime`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * @name getUnixTime
 * @category Timestamp Helpers
 * @summary Get the seconds timestamp of the given date.
 *
 * @description
 * Get the seconds timestamp of the given date.
 *
 * @param date - The given date
 *
 * @returns The timestamp
 *
 * @example
 * // Get the timestamp of 29 February 2012 11:45:05 CET:
 * const result = getUnixTime(new Date(2012, 1, 29, 11, 45, 5))
 * //=> 1330512305
 */
export function getUnixTime(date: DateArg<Date> & {}): number

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constants/index.js`, `src/constructFrom/index.js`, `src/toDate/index.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
