# Implement hoursToMinutes from date-fns

`src/hoursToMinutes/index.js` is the JavaScript build of `pkgs/core/src/hoursToMinutes/index.ts` from date-fns (https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns at commit 717ce0a807ea, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `hoursToMinutes`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * @name hoursToMinutes
 * @category Conversion Helpers
 * @summary Convert hours to minutes.
 *
 * @description
 * Convert a number of hours to a full number of minutes.
 *
 * @param hours - number of hours to be converted
 *
 * @returns The number of hours converted in minutes
 *
 * @example
 * // Convert 2 hours to minutes:
 * const result = hoursToMinutes(2)
 * //=> 120
 */
export function hoursToMinutes(hours: number): number

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constants/index.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
