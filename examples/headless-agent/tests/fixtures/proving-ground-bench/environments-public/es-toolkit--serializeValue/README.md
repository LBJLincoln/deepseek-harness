# Implement serializeValue from es-toolkit

`src/util/serialize/serialize.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/util/serialize/serialize.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `serializeValue`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Serializes a value with a shared circular reference context.
 *
 * @param value - The value to serialize.
 * @param refs - Objects that are being serialized or have been serialized,
 *   mapped to their back-reference placeholder or completed serialization.
 * @returns The serialized string.
 */
export function serializeValue(value: unknown, refs: Map<object, string>): string

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/predicate/isArrayBuffer.js`, `src/predicate/isDate.js`, `src/predicate/isError.js`, `src/predicate/isMap.js`, `src/predicate/isPlainObject.js`, `src/predicate/isRegExp.js`, `src/predicate/isSet.js`, `src/predicate/isTypedArray.js`, `src/util/hash/node.js`, `src/util/serialize/compareValues.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializeBigInt.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializeFunction.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializeNumber.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializeObject.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializePlainObject.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializeString.js`, `src/util/serialize/serializeSymbol.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
