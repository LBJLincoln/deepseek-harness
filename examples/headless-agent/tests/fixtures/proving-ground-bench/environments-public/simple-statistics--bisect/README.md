# Implement bisect from simple-statistics

`src/bisect.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/bisect.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `bisect`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * [Bisection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) is a root-finding
 * method that repeatedly bisects an interval to find the root.
 *
 * This function returns a numerical approximation to the exact value.
 *
 * @param {Function} func input function
 * @param {number} start - start of interval
 * @param {number} end - end of interval
 * @param {number} maxIterations - the maximum number of iterations
 * @param {number} errorTolerance - the error tolerance
 * @returns {number} estimated root value
 * @throws {TypeError} Argument func must be a function
 *
 * @example
 * bisect(Math.cos,0,4,100,0.003); // => 1.572265625
 */
function bisect(func, start, end, maxIterations, errorTolerance)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/sign.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
