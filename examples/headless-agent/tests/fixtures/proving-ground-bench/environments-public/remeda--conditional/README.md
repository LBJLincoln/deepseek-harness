# Implement conditional from remeda

`src/conditional.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/conditional.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `conditional`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Executes a transformer function based on the first matching predicate,
 * functioning like a series of `if...else if...` statements. It sequentially
 * evaluates each case and, upon finding a truthy predicate, runs the
 * corresponding transformer, and returns, ignoring any further cases, even if
 * they would match.
 *
 * *NOTE*: Some type-predicates may fail to narrow the param type of their
 * transformer; in such cases wrap your type-predicate in an anonymous arrow
 * function: e.g., instead of
 * `conditional(..., [myTypePredicate, myTransformer], ...)`, use
 * `conditional(..., [($) => myTypePredicate($), myTransformer], ...)`.
 *
 * To add a a default, catch-all, case you can provide a single callback
 * function (instead of a 2-tuple) as the last case. This is equivalent to
 * adding a case with a trivial always-true predicate as it's condition (see
 * example).
 *
 * For simpler cases you should also consider using `when` instead.
 *
 * Due to TypeScript's inability to infer the result of negating a type-
 * predicate we can't refine the types used in subsequent cases based on
 * previous conditions. Using a `switch (true)` statement or ternary operators
 * is recommended for more precise type control when such type narrowing is
 * needed.
 *
 * !IMPORTANT! - Unlike similar implementations in Lodash and Ramda, the Remeda
 * implementation **doesn't** implicitly return `undefined` as a fallback when
 * when none of the cases match; and instead **throws** an exception in those
 * cases! You have to explicitly provide a default case, and can use
 * `constant(undefined)` as your last case to replicate that behavior.
 *
 * @param cases - A list of (up to 10) cases. Each case can be either:
 * - A 2-tuple consisting of a predicate (or type-predicate) and a transformer
 *   function that processes the data if the predicate matches.
 * - A single callback function that acts as a default fallback case.
 * @returns The output of the matched transformer. If no cases match, an
 * exception is thrown. The return type is a union of the return types of all
 * provided transformers.
 * @signature
 *   conditional(...cases)(data);
 * @example
 *   const nameOrId = 3 as string | number | boolean;
 *
 *   pipe(
 *     nameOrId,
 *     conditional(
 *       [isString, (name) => `Hello ${name}`],
 *       [isNumber, (id) => `Hello ID: ${id}`],
 *     ),
 *   ); //=> 'Hello ID: 3' (typed as `string`), can throw!.
 *
 *   pipe(
 *     nameOrId,
 *     conditional(
 *       [isString, (name) => `Hello ${name}`],
 *       [isNumber, (id) => `Hello ID: ${id}`],
 *       constant(undefined),
 *     ),
 *   ); //=> 'Hello ID: 3' (typed as `string | undefined`), won't throw.
 *
 *   pipe(
 *     nameOrId,
 *     conditional(
 *       [isString, (name) => `Hello ${name}`],
 *       [isNumber, (id) => `Hello ID: ${id}`],
 *       (something) => `Hello something (${JSON.stringify(something)})`,
 *     ),
 *   ); //=> 'Hello ID: 3' (typed as `string`), won't throw.
 * @dataLast

export function conditional(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/constant.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/purryOn.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/isDeepEqual.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.

This task is derived from `packages/remeda/src/conditional.ts` of remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda) at commit `e8292ddf03f8a334cf8b048983d518f89fe6be97`, distributed under the MIT licence (Copyright (c) 2018 remeda); the licence text is kept in `LICENSE` and accompanies every copy of this task and anything derived from it.

## Types the module declares

The module's TypeScript source declares these types; the JavaScript build in `src/conditional.js` erased them.

```ts
type Case<
  In,
  Out,
  When extends (x: In) => boolean = (x: In) => boolean,
> = readonly [when: When, then: (x: GuardType<When, In> & In) => Out];

type DefaultCase<In, Out> = (x: In) => Out;
```
