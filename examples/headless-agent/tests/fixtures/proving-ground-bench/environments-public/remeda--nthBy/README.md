# Implement nthBy from remeda

`src/nthBy.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/nthBy.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `nthBy`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Retrieves the element that would be at the given index if the array were sorted according to specified rules. This function uses the *QuickSelect* algorithm running at an average complexity of *O(n)*. Semantically it is equivalent to `sortBy(data, ...rules).at(index)` which would run at *O(nlogn)*.
 *
 * See also `firstBy` which provides an even more efficient algorithm and a stricter return type, but only for `index === 0`. See `takeFirstBy` to get all the elements up to and including `index`.
 *
 * @param data - The input array.
 * @param index - The zero-based index for selecting the element in the sorted order. Negative indices count backwards from the end.
 * @param rules - A variadic array of order rules defining the sorting criteria. Each order rule is a projection function that extracts a comparable value from the data. Sorting is based on these extracted values using the native `<` and `>` operators. Earlier rules take precedence over later ones. Use the syntax `[projection, "desc"]` for descending order.
 * @returns The element at the specified index in the sorted order, or `undefined` if the index is out of bounds.
 * @signature
 *   nthBy(data, index, ...rules);
 * @example
 *   nthBy([2,1,4,5,3,], 2, identity()); // => 3
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array
 */
export function nthBy(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/identity.js`, `src/internal/purryOrderRules.js`, `src/internal/quickSelect.js`, `src/internal/swapInPlace.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/pipe.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
