# Implement numericSort from simple-statistics

`src/numeric_sort.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/numeric_sort.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `numericSort`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Sort an array of numbers by their numeric value, ensuring that the
 * array is not changed in place.
 *
 * This is necessary because the default behavior of .sort
 * in JavaScript is to sort arrays as string values
 *
 *     [1, 10, 12, 102, 20].sort()
 *     // output
 *     [1, 10, 102, 12, 20]
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x input array
 * @return {Array<number>} sorted array
 * @private
 * @example
 * numericSort([3, 2, 1]) // => [1, 2, 3]
 */
function numericSort(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
