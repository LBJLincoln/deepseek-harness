# Implement kernelDensityEstimation from simple-statistics

`src/kernel_density_estimation.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/kernel_density_estimation.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `kernelDensityEstimation`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * [Kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation)
 * is a useful tool for, among other things, estimating the shape of the
 * underlying probability distribution from a sample.
 *
 * @name kernelDensityEstimation
 * @param X sample values
 * @param kernel The kernel function to use. If a function is provided, it should return non-negative values and integrate to 1. Defaults to 'gaussian'.
 * @param bandwidthMethod The "bandwidth selection" method to use, or a fixed bandwidth value. Defaults to "nrd", the commonly-used ["normal reference distribution" rule-of-thumb](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/bandwidth.nrd.html).
 * @returns {Function} An estimated [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) for the given sample. The returned function runs in `O(X.length)`.
 */
function kernelDensityEstimation(X, kernel, bandwidthMethod)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/interquartile_range.js`, `src/mean.js`, `src/quantile.js`, `src/quantile_sorted.js`, `src/quickselect.js`, `src/sample_standard_deviation.js`, `src/sample_variance.js`, `src/sum.js`, `src/sum_nth_power_deviations.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
