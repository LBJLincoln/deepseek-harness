# Implement swapProps from remeda

`src/swapProps.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/swapProps.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `swapProps`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Swaps the values of two properties in an object based on the provided keys.
 *
 * @param data - The object to be manipulated.
 * @param key1 - The first property key.
 * @param key2 - The second property key.
 * @returns Returns the manipulated object.
 * @signature
 *   swapProps(data, key1, key2)
 * @example
 *   swapProps({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, 'a', 'b') // => {a: 2, b: 1, c: 3}
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Object
 */
export function swapProps(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.

## Attribution

This task is derived from `packages/remeda/src/swapProps.ts` of remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda) at commit `e8292ddf03f8a334cf8b048983d518f89fe6be97`, distributed under the MIT licence (Copyright (c) 2018 remeda); the licence text is kept in `LICENSE` and accompanies every copy of this task and anything derived from it.

## Types the module declares

The module's TypeScript source declares these types; the JavaScript build in `src/swapProps.js` erased them.

```ts
type SwappedProps<T, K1 extends keyof T, K2 extends keyof T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K1 extends K ? K2 : K2 extends K ? K1 : K];
};
```
