# Implement zip from es-toolkit

`src/array/zip.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/array/zip.ts` from es-toolkit (https://github.com/toss/es-toolkit at commit d6f796064886, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `zip`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Combines multiple arrays into a single array of tuples.
 *
 * This function takes multiple arrays and returns a new array where each element is a tuple
 * containing the corresponding elements from the input arrays. If the input arrays are of
 * different lengths, the resulting array will have the length of the longest input array,
 * with undefined values for missing elements.
 *
 * @template T
 * @param arrs - The arrays to zip together.
 * @returns A new array of tuples containing the corresponding elements from the input arrays.
 *
 * @example
 * const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
 * const arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
 * const arr3 = [true, false];
 * const result = zip(arr1, arr2, arr3);
 * // result will be [[1, 'a', true], [2, 'b', false], [3, 'c', undefined]]
 */
export function zip<T>(...arrs: Array<readonly T[]>): T[][]

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/array/unzipWith.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
