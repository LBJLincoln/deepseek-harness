# Implement partition from remeda

`src/partition.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/partition.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `partition`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Splits a collection into two groups, the first of which contains elements the
 * `predicate` type guard passes, and the second one containing the rest.
 *
 * @param data - The items to split.
 * @param predicate - A function to execute for each element in the array. It
 * should return `true` to add the element to the first partition, and `false`
 * to add the element to the other partition. A type-predicate can also be used
 * to narrow the result.
 * @returns A 2-tuple of arrays where the first array contains the elements that
 * passed the predicate, and the second array contains the elements that did
 * not. The items are in the same order as they were in the original array.
 * @signature
 *    partition(data, predicate)
 * @example
 *    partition(
 *      ['one', 'two', 'forty two'],
 *      x => x.length === 3,
 *    ); // => [['one', 'two'], ['forty two']]
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Array
 */
export function partition(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/internal/utilityEvaluators.js`, `src/isNumber.js`, `src/pipe.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
