# Implement sum from simple-statistics

`src/sum.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/sum.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `sum`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Our default sum is the [Kahan-Babuska algorithm](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1760/7d467cda1d0277ad272deb2113533131dc09.pdf).
 * This method is an improvement over the classical
 * [Kahan summation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm).
 * It aims at computing the sum of a list of numbers while correcting for
 * floating-point errors. Traditionally, sums are calculated as many
 * successive additions, each one with its own floating-point roundoff. These
 * losses in precision add up as the number of numbers increases. This alternative
 * algorithm is more accurate than the simple way of calculating sums by simple
 * addition.
 *
 * This runs in `O(n)`, linear time, with respect to the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x input
 * @return {number} sum of all input numbers
 * @example
 * sum([1, 2, 3]); // => 6
 */
function sum(x)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/approx_equal.js`, `src/binomial_distribution.js`, `src/epsilon.js`, `src/gammaln.js`, `src/max.js`, `src/max_distribution_cells.js`, `src/poisson_distribution.js`, `src/relative_error.js`, `src/sum_simple.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
