# Implement mergeDeep from remeda

`src/mergeDeep.js` is the JavaScript build of `packages/remeda/src/mergeDeep.ts` from remeda (https://github.com/remeda/remeda at commit e8292ddf03f8, MIT licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `mergeDeep`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * Merges the `source` object into the `destination` object. The merge is similar to performing `{ ...destination, ... source }` (where disjoint values from each object would be copied as-is, and for any overlapping props the value from `source` would be used); But for *each prop* (`p`), if **both** `destination` and `source` have a **plain-object** as a value, the value would be taken as the result of recursively deepMerging them (`result.p === deepMerge(destination.p, source.p)`).
 *
 * @param destination - The object to merge into. In general, this object would have it's values overridden.
 * @param source - The object to merge from. In general, shared keys would be taken from this object.
 * @returns The merged object.
 * @signature
 *    mergeDeep(destination, source)
 * @example
 *    mergeDeep({ foo: 'bar', x: 1 }, { foo: 'baz', y: 2 }) // => { foo: 'baz', x: 1, y: 2 }
 * @dataFirst
 * @category Object
 */
export function mergeDeep(...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/doNothing.js`, `src/internal/lazyDataLastImpl.js`, `src/isPlainObject.js`, `src/purry.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. `test/expect-shim.mjs` is the assertion library those cases run under; it holds no case and is fixed. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
