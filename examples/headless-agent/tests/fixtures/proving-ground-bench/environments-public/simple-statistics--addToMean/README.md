# Implement addToMean from simple-statistics

`src/add_to_mean.js` is the JavaScript build of `src/add_to_mean.js` from simple-statistics (https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics at commit 5ee3e8be581f, ISC licence, whose text is in `LICENSE`). Every export of the module is in place except `addToMean`, whose body currently throws 'not implemented'. Implement only that function's body so that it fulfills its own documentation, which the source carries as follows:

/**
 * When adding a new value to a list, one does not have to necessary
 * recompute the mean of the list in linear time. They can instead use
 * this function to compute the new mean by providing the current mean,
 * the number of elements in the list that produced it and the new
 * value to add.
 *
 * @since 2.5.0
 * @param {number} mean current mean
 * @param {number} n number of items in the list
 * @param {number} newValue the added value
 * @returns {number} the new mean
 *
 * @example
 * addToMean(14, 5, 53); // => 20.5
 */
function addToMean(mean, n, newValue)

Keep the signature exactly as given, and do not edit any other file, export, or function; `README.md` states the types the signature and the documentation name. The other files under `src/` (`src/mean.js`, `src/sum.js`) are the module's own dependencies, unchanged; read them as you need, edit none. Add no dependencies: `package.json` is fixed and `node_modules` must not exist. This task is judged on inputs you do not see: a validator runs the module's own test suite, which this workspace does not contain, against your implementation. Implement the documented contract, including every corner it states, rather than the behaviour a guessed test would pin down.
